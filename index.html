            <p>
                My name is Jordan Terry and I am currently a Customer Success Manager at Instructure. I am taking a coding bootcamp at the University of Utah because I would like to be a Web Developer. I plan to work hard in this program and build some relationships with technical hiring managers at my company in hopes that I will be able to work as a developer here at Instructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am married and have two kids. My Daughter, Adalie, is 3 years old and my son's name is Ellis and he is 1 year old. They are my motivation for most things that I do in life because I want to provide for them now and set them up for success in the future.
